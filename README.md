# votehubPH-alpha
A voting system that has topics related to Filipino culture.
This project aims to increase cultural awareness, participation and create a sense of influence. 

CURRENT VERSION: 
VOTEHUB PH PATCH 2.2 UPDATES:

	- Created Voter class that includes voter's username and password (Max of 20 Voters)(Note: Planning to increase in the future updates).
	- Created Categories class for casting the votes per category.
	- Changed the UI of the main and sub-menus to make it simpler to understand.
	- Added a method for calculating the percentage in main class.

UPCOMING FEATURES FOR PATCH 2.3 

	- Note: Not all of this might get implemented due to time restrictions and other uncertainties. :)

	- Change the "Display Results" to "Check Casted Votes" in the main menu to restrict the voters from seeing the results during the voting session.
	- The results should be displayed after all voters has casted their votes.
	- Add an Admin access:
		- If active, admin will gain access to "Display Results" even if voting is not yet done.

	- Implement the "Create Profile Function"


PAST UPDATES/COMMITS:
VOTEHUB PH PATCH 2.1 UPDATES:

	- Cleaner console interface
	- Results changed to percentages
	- Added a loop for limiting the user to only 20
		Note: this function will be deleted in the future updates (ver 2.2) 
		because I'm planning to implement a unique ID system for each voters using classes.
