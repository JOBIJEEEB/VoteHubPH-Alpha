# votehubPH-alpha
A voting system that has topics related to Filipino culture.
This project aims to increase cultural awareness, participation and create a sense of influence. 

CURRENT VERSION: 2.1
- cleaner console interface
- results changed to percentages
- added a loop for limiting the user to only 20
	note: this function will be deleted in the future updates (ver 2.2) 
	because I'm planning to implement a unique ID system for each voters using classes.
